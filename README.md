The following technologies were used in the project:

- [x] Node.js for server-side development
- [x] Socket.io for real-time communication
- [x] Framer Motion for animations
- [x] React-Toastify for notifications
- [x] TypeScript for type checking and better code organization
- [x] Jest for tests

## Main functionality
- [x] Creating a new game table or joining an existing one by ID.
