### Project Goal:
Develop a blackjack game with the ability to choose a room where users can play against each other. The game will be played in real-time, facilitating message exchange between the client and server using WebSocket.

### Main Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Ability to choose a room for the game.
- [ ] Ability to deal cards to players and the dealer.
- [ ] Ability to place a bet and start the game.
- [ ] Handling player actions, such as hit, stand, etc.
- [ ] Determining the winner and issuing the payout.
- [ ] Checking for bust (if the total score is greater than 21).
- [ ] Message exchange between the client and server using WebSocket.

### Main Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Use MobX to manage the game state.
- [ ] Use NodeJS to create the server.
- [ ] Use React to create the user interface (?)
- [ ] Use Babylon.js or Canvas to display the game field (???)
- [ ] Use WebSocket to exchange messages between the client and server.
- [ ] Use TypeScript to improve code readability and facilitate debugging.

### Testing Requirements(??):
- [ ] Test game functions.
- [ ] Test message exchange between the client and server.
- [ ] Test the user interface.
- [ ] Test on different browsers and devices.

### Planned Development Stages:
* Define functional and technical requirements.
* Develop the user interface design.
* Develop the game logic.
* Create the server in NodeJS and configure WebSocket.
* Create the user interface using React, Babylon.js or Canvas(???)
* Write code for message exchange between the client and server.
* Optimize and debug the code.
* Test the game and debug errors.
